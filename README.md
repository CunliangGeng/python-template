NLeSC Cookiecutter template for Python
======================================

This repository can be used to create empty Python projects for newly
started Python projects within the Netherlands eScience Center, being
compliant for as much as possible with the [eStep
checklist](https://nlesc.gitbooks.io/guide/content/software/software_overview.html).

This repository is intended for use with cookiecutter. Cookiecutter is a
command-line utility that creates projects from project templates. For
more information about cookiecutter checkout
<https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io>.

We've tried to keep the template as minimal as possible for now, to
prevent having to delete a lot of clutter after creating an empty
project, but if you feel something essential is missing let us know.


How to use
==========
If you don't have cookiecutter installed yet, use  
    `pip install cookiecutter`  
to install cookiecutter.

Once cookiecutter is installed you can use  
    `cookiecutter https://github.com/benvanwerkhoven/cookie_python.git`  
to create a new Python project.

After this command you will be prompted with a number of questions,
including your name, email, name for the project, small description,
license and so on. This information will be used to fill out the
template as the new project directory structure is created for you.
